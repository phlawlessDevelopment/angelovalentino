        I have been making Art in various ways since 1993, I have been installing
      Art in public spaces often without credit since 1995. I was a very early
      pioneer in digital Art. Some years ago I wrote an influential white paper
      outlining how to use the blockchain to authenticate Art and retain
      transactional control. My work is in some major collections and is in the
      hands of many important and famous collectors. I use money to make the
      world a better place, I know the work I send you will do the same. It is a
      good exchange.

        Why price in bitcoin? The accumulation of this crypto currency is a
      formidable power, but what do you do with this? I here grant an
      opportunity to do something groundbreaking. No sales pitch, just a polite
      request to trust in Art. Until this moment the buying of art was
      transactionally a one-way process, controlled by gaping inequalities and
      co-invested gatekeepers. Today the power to change this rests in you and
      with an artist, as honest collaborators, thank you.
