        There are no images of my Artwork on this website. Nevertheless I ask
        people to trust me and buy my Art on blind faith. I ask 3 things: send
        full payment, tell me something about themselves, and their postal
        address. In exchange I promise to send you a large beautiful piece of
        wall Art.
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold">
        But hold on! This is the internet, this has to be some kind of con
        trick?
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold">
        Let's be truthful for a moment, the idea of buying an Artwork of value
        without ever looking at it, even directly from a world famous Artist, is
        not what the majority of ordinary people would ever do. Let alone me,
        who you have probably* never heard of.

        If you are curious, or *know my work and like it & can afford the price
        – just go directly to the bottom of this page, and I will send you a
        work of Art. I guarantee you will not regret buying it.

        If you remain skeptical and need more information, here below is why you
        should trust an Artist, obtain a great work of Art and help make a
        needed disruption to the art business.
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold">
        Technology has given us many thousand forms of irresistible
        gratification and constant distraction from self awareness. Sometimes it
        takes a power cut, a black out, to make us look up and slowly recall an
        important promise we all make to ourselves: To try and have only real
        people and real things around us, things that bring value and meaning,
        not more noise. I will give you that, but you are going to have to trust
        me, and for many people that is already way too much.
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold">
        There is obvious absence of my Art on the internet: the main reasons are
        copying, fraud and exclusivity, in short:
      </div>
      <div class="font-bold">
        "I kindly ask that all collectors, galleries and museums that are in
        possession of my signed artworks NOT to reproduce any copies online, on
        their websites or on social media."
      </div>
      <div class="font-bold">
        I like to have a private exhibition every few years and sell works:
        invitations sent, people come, see and buy. My prices reflect what goes
        into the work, and the rarity, and I sell most of what I show.

      <div class="font-bold">
        I fully realise what sticking to my principle of "no reproduction
        online" means, i.e. to some people you are a complete ghost… And to be
        honest that is almost OK, this new work is beautiful, powerful, and
        noble, it was not made to entertain the public. I did not spend a decade
        to just make nice pictures for people to swipe past.
      </div>
      <div class="font-bold">
        This new series was made to be a perfection, an answer to the imperfect
        human questions.

        Selling this way, it will only belong only to a few self selecting,
        interesting & sighted people. If you can buy a work like this and take
        the small risk today, then you are the kind of person that will
        understand and find this work breathtaking.

          opportunity to feel something real, for me it was a wave of emotion,

          Making this latest collection of 48 photographic works consumed nearly
          ten years, it was exciting to start, but to complete it properly was
          one of the hardest things I have ever done. An undertaking roughly
          splitting into five herculean "labours", for my sanity I have to
          reduced the stages of my journey into these Sci-fi book titles and say
          little more:

        Across the glittering oceans of humanity.

        To make this something that can be called Art, beyond just a beautiful
        visual account of the human condition, needed a wholly different
        process: to completely obfuscate of all the cotton, hay and rags of
        life, and to look clear heartedly inward and own the truth of one's
        time, to exclude repetitions, excise vanities, cut away sentiments, and
        pull a distilled insight out of meaning, so as to be relevant to others.

        If done right, something life altering can happen when enough emotion,
        experience and human honesty are concentrated at one time and in one
        object. In that moment something strikes deep inside and the meanings of
        common words can be changed, and things ugly written are reset, anything
        can be forgiven, a life transformed. Angelo Valentino
